This dashboard runs on my Tablet.
Requires **Selene**, **Toile** and is write is object oriented kind of Lua scripts.

It is split in several sub directory : 

# Specific to my dashboard.
* **HDB** (and top level **HDB.sel**) : Specific settings and high level implementations for my dashboard
* **HDB_320** : The same for a 3.5 screen like on my BananaPI
* **Images** images used.
