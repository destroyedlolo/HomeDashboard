This version of "**HomeDashBoard**" is targeting a tiny I2C OLed display.

As in [ArduiPI_OLed](https://github.com/destroyedlolo/ArduiPi_OLED) library, there is no notion of *windows* nor *graphical elements* (as the day of writing, the display surface seems too tiny to have such feature useful ... may change in future), displaying is very basic and data are refreshed ONLY when a new page is displayed.
